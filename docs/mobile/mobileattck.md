# MobileAttck

This documentation provides details about the MobileAttck class within the `pyattck` package.

The MobileAttck class provides detailed information about data within the MITRE Mobile ATT&CK framework

Each of the `main` properties can return a json object of the entire object or you can access each property individually.  An example of this is here:

```python
from pyattck import Attck

attack = Attck()

# accessing techniques and their properties
for technique in attack.mobile.techniques:
	# if you want to return individual properties of this object you call them directly
	print(technique.id)
	print(technique.name)
	print(technique.alias)
	print(technique.description)
	print(technique.stix)
	print(technique.platforms)
	.....
```

The following is only a small sample of the available properties on each object and each object type (actors, malware, mitigations, tactics, techniques, and tools) will have different properties that you can access.

* Every data point has exposed properties that allow the user to retrieve additional data based on relationships:
    * [Actor](actor.md)
        * Relationship Objects
            * Tools used by the Actor or Group
            * Malware used by the Actor or Group
            * Techniques this Actor or Group uses
        * External Data
            * Retrieve a logo for an actor using ascii_logo properties
            * country which this actor or group may be associated with (attribution is hard)
            * operations 
            * attribution_links
            * known_tools
            * targets
            * additional_comments
            * external_description
    * [Malware](malware.md)
        * Actor or Group(s) using this malware
        * Techniques this malware is used with
    * [Mitigation](mitigation.md)
        * Techniques related to a specific set of mitigation suggestions
    * [Tactic](tactic.md)
        * Techniques found in a specific Tactic (phase)
    * [Technique](technique.md)
        * Relationship Objects
            * Tactics a technique is found in
            * Mitigation suggestions for a given technique
            * Actor or Group(s) identified as using this technique
        * External Data
            * command_list - A list of commands from multiple open-source tools and repositories that contain potential commands used by a technique
            * commands - A list of property objects that contain the `Name`, `Source, and `Command` dataset
            * queries - A list of potential queries for different products to identify threats within your environment by technique
            * datasets - A list of the datasets as it relates to a technique
            * possible_detections -  A list of potential detections for different products (e.g. NSM rules) as it relates to a technique
            * For more detailed information about these features, please view the following  [External Datasets](../dataset/dataset.md)
    * [Tools](tools.md)
        * Relationship Objects
            * Techniques that the specified tool is used within
            * Actor or Group(s) using a specified tool
        * External Data
            * additional_names for the specified tool
            * attribution_links associated with the specified tool
            * additional_comments about the specified tool
            * family of the specified tool
