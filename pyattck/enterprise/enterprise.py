class Enterprise(object):

    '''
        This class creates an interface to all data points in the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise framework.

        This interface enables you to retrieve all properties within each item in the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Framework.

        The following categorical items can be accessed using this class:

            1. Tactics (Tactics are the phases defined by MITRE ATT&CK)
            2. Techniques (Techniques are the individual actions which can accomplish a tactic)
            3. Mitigations (Mitigations are recommendations to prevent or protect against a technique)
            4. Actors (Actors or Groups are identified malicious actors/groups which have been identified and documented by MITRE & third-parties)
            5. Tools (Tools are software used to perform techniques)
            6. Malwares (Malwares are specific pieces of malware used by actors (or in general) to accomplish a technique)

        You can also search the external dataset for external commands that are similar using the `search_commands` method.

           .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

               for search in attck.enterprise.search_commands('powershell'):
                   print(search['technique'])
                   print(search['reason_for_match'])

        Additionally, as of pyattck 2.0.0 you can now access additional datasets related to a technique.
        These datasets are [documented here](https://github.com/swimlane/pyattck/blob/master/generateattcks/README.md).

        Each technique enables you to access the following properties on the object:

            1. command_list - A list of commands associated with a technique
            2. commands = A list of dictionary objects containing source, command, and provided name associated with a technique
            3. queries = A list of dictionary objects containing product, query, and name associated with a technique
            4. datasets = A list of raw datasets associated with a technique
            5. possible_detections = A list of raw datasets containing possible detection methods for a technique

        Each Actor object (if available) enables you to access the following properties on the object:

            1. country
            2. operations
            3. attribution_links
            4. known_tools
            5. targets
            6. additional_comments
            7. external_description

        You can retrieve the entire dataset using the `external_dataset` property on a `actor` object.

        pyattck also enables you to retrieve or generate logos for the actor or group using the following properties:

            - ascii_logo - Generated ASCII logo based on the actor or groups name
            - image_logo - Generated ASCII logo based on a provided logo

        Each Tools object (if available) enables you to access the following properties on the object:

            1. additional_names
            2. attribution_links
            3. additional_comments
            4. family

        You can retrieve the entire dataset using the `external_dataset` property on a `tool` object.

        You can also access external data properties from the C2 Matrix project. The following properties are generated using C2 Matrix external data:

        You can retrieve the entire dataset using the `c2_data` property.

    Example:
        Once an Attck object is instantiated, you can access each object type as a list of objects (e.g. techniques, tactics, actors, etc.)

        You can iterate over each object list and access specific properties and relationship properties of each.

        The following relationship properties are accessible:
            1. Actors
                1. Tools used by the Actor or Group
                2. Malware used by the Actor or Group
                3. Techniques this Actor or Group uses
            2. Malwares
                1. Actor or Group(s) using this malware
                2. Techniques this malware is used with
            3. Mitigations
                1. Techniques related to a specific set of mitigation suggestions
            4. Tactics
                1. Techniques found in a specific Tactic (phase)
            5. Techniques
                1. Tactics a technique is found in
                2. Mitigation suggestions for a given technique
                3. Actor or Group(s) identified as using this technique
            6. Tools
                1. Techniques that the specified tool is used within
                2. Actor or Group(s) using a specified tool

            1. To iterate over a list, do the following:

            .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

               for technique in attck.enterprise.techniques:
                   print(technique.id)
                   print(technique.name)
                   print(technique.description)
                   # etc.

               for mitigation in attck.enterprise.mitigations:
                   print(mitigation.id)
                   print(mitigation.name)
                   print(mitigation.description)
                   # etc.

            2. To access relationship properties, do the following:

            .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

               for technique in attck.enterprise.techniques:
                   print(technique.id)
                   print(technique.name)
                   print(technique.description)
                   # etc.

                       print(actor.id)
                       print(actor.name)
                       print(actor.description)
                       # etc.

                   print(mitigation.id)
                   print(mitigation.name)
                   print(mitigation.description)
                   # etc.

                   for technique in mitigation.techniques:
                       print(technique.name)
                       print(technique.description)
                       # etc.
