class PreAttck(object):

    '''
        This class creates an interface to all data points in the MITRE PRE-ATT&CK framework.

        This interface enables you to retrieve all properties within each item in the MITRE PRE-ATT&CK Framework.

        The following categorical items can be accessed using this class:

            1. Tactics (Tactics are the phases defined by MITRE ATT&CK)
            2. Techniques (Techniques are the individual actions which can accomplish a tactic)
            3. Actors (Actors or Groups are identified malicious actors/groups which have been identified and documented by MITRE & third-parties)

        Each Actor object (if available) enables you to access the following properties on the object:

            1. country
            2. operations
            3. attribution_links
            4. known_tools
            5. targets
            6. additional_comments
            7. external_description

        You can retrieve the entire dataset using the `external_dataset` property on a `actor` object.

        pyattck also enables you to retrieve or generate logos for the actor or group using the following properties:

            - ascii_logo - Generated ASCII logo based on the actor or groups name

    Example:
        Once an Attck object is instantiated, you can access each object type as a list of objects (e.g. techniques, tactics, actors, etc.)

        You can iterate over each object list and access specific properties and relationship properties of each.

        The following relationship properties are accessible:
            1. Actors
                1. Techniques this Actor or Group uses
            2. Tactics
                1. Techniques found in a specific Tactic (phase)
            3. Techniques
                1. Tactics a technique is found in
                2. Actor or Group(s) identified as using this technique

            1. To iterate over a list, do the following:

            .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

               for technique in attck.preattack.techniques:
                   print(technique.id)
                   print(technique.name)
                   print(technique.description)
                   # etc.

            2. To access relationship properties, do the following:

            .. code-block:: python

               from pyattck import Attck

               attck = Attck()

               for technique in attck.preattack.techniques:
                   print(technique.id)
                   print(technique.name)
                   print(technique.description)
                   # etc.

                   for actor in technique.actors:
                       print(actor.id)
                       print(actor.name)
                       print(actor.description)
                       # etc.
